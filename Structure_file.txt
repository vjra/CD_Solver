A experiment could be a class with defined variables and methods

take several initial condition functions to choose and of course the possibility to create one

# Todo list:

* merge solvers

# Ideas:

* write stuff with lambda thingy
* make same without classes



#Variables for a Experiment:

## Initial variables:
polyorder ... Polynomial order
dt ... time step size
h ... space discretization parameter
refineyn ... refinement switch, yes or no
initialfunction ... object of initial function


# Methods for a the experiment class:

* run solver
* surface plot stuff
* paraview export
* matplotlib export
* heatmap plot
